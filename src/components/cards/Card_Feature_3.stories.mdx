# Card Feature 3

CardFeature3 will automatically fill the width of its parent container.  You can give it its own width by providing the `classes` attribute.
This example applies a `max-w-120` class:

<div class="mb-12">
  <Story id="cards-feature-3--example" />
</div>

### imgAlt is required to show the img

If `imgAlt` is missing, the image will not show, even if you've provided `imgSrc`:

<Story id="cards-feature-3--missing-img-alt"/>
